# Semi-professional-game

This game was my summer internship as a part of my studies at MediaStadi.

I found those guys online and applied for a position of a developer and artist. So we've agreed that during the summer I'll complete design, art and implementation of Main Menu and in Game UI.

Because it was an online collaboration, we worked via GitLab and GitKraken. Well, I have to say I don't know it perfectly, but well enough to collaborate without any problems.

So during June and July I have used Adobe Xd to develop a prototype of main manu ui. During this time I've worked with Lead Designer and Project Lead to make sure I include every screen that they need for the first prototype build.

Then I've started working in Unity, implementing this prototype from Adobe Xd. This took a while at first to imagine how it should work, in what sequence and order. And then it became a repetitive job to make sure that every single button works. Also I've tried to make my code as clean as possible for the next person to have no problems understanding what is where and how it works.

After that I've started making art for UI. For now (30.07.2019) I've done buttons, text boxes and top bar.
